	•	Remove hardcoded or placeholder data causing errors.
	•	Ensure API endpoints return clean, structured data for frontend rendering.

	•	Manage applications (view, sort, update status)
	•	Manage universities/programs (add/edit/delete/activate/deactivate, bulk upload, batch ops)
	•	Manage agents (add/edit/delete/activate/deactivate, view app count)
	•	Manage admin users (activate/deactivate)
	•	Use Refresh buttons everywhere
	•	No runtime errors

👉 Optional Support
If needed, I can help generate:

	•	📌 Frontend mock layouts
	•	📌 Sample CSV/Excel schema for bulk upload
