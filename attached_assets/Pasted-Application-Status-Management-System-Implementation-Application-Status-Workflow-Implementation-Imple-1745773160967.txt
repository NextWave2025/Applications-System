Application Status Management System Implementation
Application Status Workflow Implementation
Implement a comprehensive status management system with the following statuses and restrictions:
Agent-Controlled Statuses

Draft

Enable agents to save incomplete applications when not all required fields are filled
Implement save functionality that preserves partial progress
Visual indicator showing which fields remain incomplete
Allow agents to return and continue editing draft applications


Submitted

Available only when all required fields are properly completed
Implement thorough validation checks before allowing submission
Once submitted, application becomes read-only for the agent
Send confirmation notification to agent upon successful submission



Admin-Only Controlled Statuses
The following statuses must be exclusively modifiable by administrators:

Submitted to University

Only admins can transition applications to this status
Track submission date and admin who made the change


Action Required

Implement notification system alerting agents when their application needs attention
Require admins to include specific action requirements in notes
Notes written by admin must be prominently displayed to the agent


Accepted

Include two distinct sub-statuses:

Conditional Offer: Require admin to specify conditions
Payment Pending: Trigger payment notification to agent


Admin must be able to select either sub-status independently


Payment Clearing

Implement admin interface for tracking payment verification process
Include document upload capability for payment confirmations


Rejected

Require mandatory rejection reason from admin
Store rejection rationale in application history



Status Change Management Requirements

For ALL admin-controlled status changes:

Implement confirmation popup dialog before status changes take effect
Include mandatory note field within the confirmation popup
All admin notes must be stored in application history
Display admin notes to the respective agent in their application view
Maintain complete audit trail of all status transitions



Technical Implementation Details

Ensure both frontend and backend enforce status change restrictions
Create status-specific validation rules for each transition
Implement proper error handling for invalid status change attempts
Design database schema to store status history with timestamps and notes
Add robust security checks to prevent unauthorized status modifications

Implement this system to ensure transparent application tracking while maintaining appropriate access controls between agents and administrators.
