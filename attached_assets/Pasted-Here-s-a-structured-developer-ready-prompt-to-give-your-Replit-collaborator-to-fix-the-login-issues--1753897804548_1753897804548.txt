Here’s a structured developer-ready prompt to give your Replit collaborator to fix the login issues, redirection delays, and user role mismatch handling:

✅ Prompt for Developer — Login Redirect & Role-Based Logic Fix

⸻

Hi,

Please help resolve the following issues related to login, redirection, and user-role verification across all account types (Admin, Agent, Student):

⸻

🐞 1. Login Redirection Delay (Admin & Agent)
	•	Currently, admin and agent login/signup works, but the redirect only happens after manually refreshing the page.
	•	The issue occurs right after pressing the login/signup button and seeing the “Welcome” popup.

🔧 Action:
	•	Ensure that after successful login/signup, the user is automatically redirected to the correct dashboard without needing a page refresh.
	•	Fix this for both admin and agent login/signup flows.

⸻

🐞 2. Student Login Issue – “Invalid Credentials”
	•	Currently, the student login/signup flow throws this error:

[plugin:runtime-error-plugin] Invalid credentials


	•	Even after registering, login is not successful.

🔧 Action:
	•	Debug and fix the student login/signup flow so it properly checks credentials and redirects the user to the student dashboard on success.
	•	Ensure user role detection and token handling are correctly applied to students.

⸻

🚧 3. Role Mismatch Login Warning (New Feature)

🔧 Action:
	•	Add a pop-up alert or toast message when a user tries to log in with details meant for a different role.

✅ Logic Example:
	•	If a user with a student account tries to log in via the agent login page, show:
⚠️ “This account is registered as a student. Please log in via the student portal or sign up with a new agent account.”
	•	If an agent tries to log in via the student login:
⚠️ “This account is registered as an agent. Please use the agent login page or register a new student account.”

✅ Technical:
	•	Use role check on backend response or in token/user profile
	•	Trigger client-side modal or toast popup when mismatched

⸻

✅ Final Redirection Flow Per Role

Role	Login Page Path	Redirect Path After Login
Admin	/admin-login	/admin-dashboard
Agent	/agent-login	/agent-dashboard
Student	/student-login	/student-dashboard

Please ensure that role-based redirection happens immediately on login success, and that token/session is handled properly.

Let me know once deployed or if you need help testing each flow. Thanks!
