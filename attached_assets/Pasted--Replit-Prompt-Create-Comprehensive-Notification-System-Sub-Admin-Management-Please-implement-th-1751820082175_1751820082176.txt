Replit Prompt: Create Comprehensive Notification System + Sub-Admin Management

Please implement the following features on the admin side:



1️⃣ Comprehensive Notification System

✅ What to build
Create an automated email notification system that sends the super admin (and optionally sub-admins) an email in real-time whenever these events occur:
	•	A new application is submitted by a user.
	•	An application status changes (e.g. approved, rejected, pending, etc.).
	•	A new user account is created by a user (sign-up).

✅ Notification details
	•	The email must include:
	•	The type of event (e.g. New Application, Application Status Changed, New User Account Created).
	•	Key details of the event:
	•	For applications: applicant name, program name, status, submission date.
	•	For status changes: previous status, new status, date of change.
	•	For account creation: user name, email, date created.
	•	Subject line should clearly state the event (e.g. New Application Received – Program X).

✅ Technical requirements
	•	Use your existing email service (e.g. SendGrid, SMTP, or integrated Replit mail service).
	•	Ensure emails are sent in real-time as soon as the event occurs.
	•	Handle delivery errors gracefully (log failures, retry if necessary).



2️⃣ Sub-Admin Management

✅ What to build
	•	Allow the super admin to create sub-admin accounts through the admin panel.
	•	Required fields for creating a sub-admin:
	•	Name
	•	Email
	•	Password (set by super admin at creation)
	•	Automatically send a welcome email to the sub-admin with their credentials and a prompt to change their password on first login.
	•	Sub-admins should have restricted permissions (only manage apps/accounts as allowed by the super admin).

✅ Sub-admin features
	•	Ability for sub-admins to:
	•	View and manage applications.
	•	Update application statuses.
	•	View user account details.
	•	No access to creating new sub-admins or changing super admin settings.

✅ Technical requirements
	•	Validate form inputs (required fields, valid email, strong password).
	•	Display confirmation when a sub-admin is created.
	•	Allow super admin to deactivate or delete sub-admin accounts.



Expected Result
	•	The super admin (and optional sub-admins) will receive email notifications for key user and application activities.
	•	Super admin can create and manage sub-admins to assist in managing applications and user accounts.
	•	All actions provide clear feedback and update the UI dynamically.
