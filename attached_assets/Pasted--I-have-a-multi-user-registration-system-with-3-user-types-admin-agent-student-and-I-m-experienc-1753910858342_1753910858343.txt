"I have a multi-user registration system with 3 user types (admin, agent, student) and I'm experiencing redirect issues after successful registration. When users complete registration and press the submit button, the page doesn't automatically redirect to their respective dashboards - I have to manually refresh the page for the redirect to work.
Please help me diagnose and fix this issue by analyzing:
Registration form submission logic - Check if I'm properly handling form submission and preventing default browser behavior
Authentication state management - Verify if user authentication state is being updated correctly before attempting redirect
Navigation implementation - Examine if I'm using proper navigation methods (useNavigate, router.push, window.location, etc.)
Async operation handling - Check if redirects are happening before API calls complete
User role-based routing logic - Verify the conditional logic that determines which dashboard each user type should be redirected to
Error handling - Look for any silent errors preventing redirects
State synchronization - Check if there are timing issues between state updates and navigation
Specific issues to investigate:
Are redirects wrapped in proper async/await or .then() blocks?
Is the navigation happening before authentication tokens are set?
Are there any console errors during registration?
Is the user state properly updated before navigation?
Please provide:
Specific code fixes for proper post-registration navigation
Recommended navigation patterns for React/JavaScript applications
Error handling improvements for registration flow
Code examples for role-based redirect logic after successful registration
The expected behavior should be:
Admin → redirects to admin dashboard
Agent → redirects to agent dashboard
Student → redirects to student dashboard
Currently, all user types require manual page refresh for redirect to work."
Additional Debugging Steps You Can Try:
Check Browser Console for JavaScript errors during registration
Add console.log statements before and after redirect attempts
Verify API response timing - ensure redirects happen after successful API responses
Test network tab to see if registration API calls are completing properly
